### Genre Classification using Keras

Dataset: “Musical genre classification of audio signals “ by G. Tzanetakis and P. Cook in IEEE Transactions on Audio and Speech Processing 2002
* Extracting following features from spectogram:
  * Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)(20 in number)
  * Spectral Centroid,
  * Zero Crossing Rate
  * Chroma Frequencies
  * Spectral Roll-off
* Encoding the Labels
* Scaling the Feature columns
